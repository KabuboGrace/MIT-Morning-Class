Abstract The paper establishes a taxonomy of image-text relationships that reflects the ways that
images.It is applicable to all subject areas and document types. The taxonomy
was developed to answer the research question: how does an illustration relate to the text with
which it is associated, or, what are the functions of illustration? Developed in a two-stage process –
first, analysis of relevant research in children’s literature, dictionary development, education,
journalism, and library and information design and, second, subsequent application of the first
version of the taxonomy to 954 image-text pairs in 45 Web pages (pages with educational content
for children, online newspapers, and retail business pages) – the taxonomy identifies 49
relationships and groups them in three categories according to the closeness of the conceptual
relationship between image and text. The paper uses qualitative content analysis to illustrate use of
the taxonomy to analyze four image-text pairs in government publications and discusses the
implications of the research for information retrieval and document design.
Documents are complex tools created to communicate messages to readers.
Among the elements used in developing documents are prose, images, font
types, color, and spatial relationships. The message is a wedding of these
components, and the interplay among all elements is a critical concern to people
who need to convey information effectively. This paper focuses on an
increasingly important aspect of this problem – the relationships between text
and images. In writing about the design of Web sites, where images are widely
used in conjunction with prose, Karen A. Schriver (1997, pp. 406-7) says:
We have almost no knowledge about how best to structure the relationships between words
and pictures on the Web . . . too much time in document design circles is being spent arguing
over the details of HTML code . . . It’s the interplay of prose and graphics that ought to
concern us.
The paper creates a taxonomy of relationships between images and text that
can be used for analyzing the way that images and text interact. It is applicable
to all subject areas and all types of documents. Writers and illustrators can use
it as a tool as they create documents, and researchers can analyze the
relationships between image and prose to identify and predict the effects of
combinations once documents have been published.</p>
